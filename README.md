## Usage

### Example
    DraggableGridViewBuilder(
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 2,
          childAspectRatio: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width /
              (MediaQuery.of(context).size.height / 3),
        ),
        listOfWidgets: listOfWidgets,
        dragCompletion: this,
        isOnlyLongPress: false,
        dragFeedback: this,
        dragPlaceHolder: this,
      );

### Required parameters

##### gridDelegate:
A delegate that controls the layout of the children within the GridView.

##### listOfWidgets:
listOfWidgets is use to show the widgets inside the GridView.builder to provide the drag & drop functionality.

##### _dragCompletion:
this property contains DragCompletion implementation. You have to override and store updated list (if needed).


## Optional parameters

##### isOnlyLongPress:
this property contains boolean value. If this property is false then it works with simple press draggable or else it works with long press. default value is 'true'. 

##### dragFeedback:
this property contains DragFeedback implementation. If this property overrides then you have to return a Widget and we will use this widget in feedback. Learn more about feedback from [Draggable](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Draggable-class.html#:~:text=Draggable%20class%20Null%20safety,user's%20finger%20across%20the%20screen) class. 

##### dragPlaceHolder:
this property contains DragPlaceHolder implementation. If this property overrides then you have to return a PlaceHolderWidget and we will use this widget in place holder. 

##### dragChildWhenDragging:
this property contains DragChildWhenDragging implementation. If this property overrides then you have to return a Widget and we will display this widget instead of child when drags are under way.

### Last but not least you can use all the [GridView.builder] properties :heart_eyes:


## Note:
The result returns in List. so it can be lost later, you are responsible for storing it somewhere permanent (if needed).
